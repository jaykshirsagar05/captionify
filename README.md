[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iqwn5OKrrBD1vxx7EoGJRvEquBfxwQpX?usp=sharing)

## Description
A webapp which can generate brief captions from images.
We have used a merge model similar to "Show and tell architecture" to generate brief captions.
We trained model on flickr8k dataset with the help of google colab.

## Visuals
Below is the demo output of our model

## Installation
Basic requirements
* Python3
* Docker

## Deploy as a docker image and run
Steps to run in your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaykshirsagar05/captionify.git
cd Captionify
Docker-compose build
Docker-compose up
```
visit to http://172.19.0.3:8501/ for streamlit app.

visit to for http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs server side(fastapi)

NOTE: You need to change the path of pre-trained model in ![caption.py](https://github.com/jaykshirsagar05/captionify/blob/master/fastapi/caption.py) file.
